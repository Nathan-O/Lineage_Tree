NOTE: FOR TOMORROW:

 - Look up data visualization. How can I render
   the family and family members in a tree form? (LINKED LIST??)

 - What do I need to do to add a person to a family?
   In the family show page? Have an ADD A MEMBER BUTTON?
   That would mean the best way to flow the sight would
   be to redirect after User clicks "Create Family" I
   also need to figure out how to presist the family
   last name to the person (unless the User changes the
   name manually).

 - How do I show family relationships? So far I have
   an idea of drop boxes under marked fields (i.e. a
   drop down box labeled "Siblings" and has a list of
   family members. Choose all that apply then when the
   list gets sent to the back end iterate through and
   push them to the Sibling association KEY).
